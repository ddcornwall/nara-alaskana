Greer\n\n\n\tWhen the U-2 began operating in the summer of 1956, it was expected to have a relatively short operational life in over flying the Soviet Union — perhaps no more than a year or two. That expectation was based not so much on the likelihood that the Soviets could develop the means of shooting it down, is on their ability to develop a radar surveillance network cable tracking the U-2 reliably. With accurate tracking data in hand, the Soviets could file a medical test with enough supporting evidence to generate political pressures to discontinue the overflights. As it turned out, the United States had underestimated the Soviet radars, which probably acquired and continuously tracked the very first U-2 flight over Soviet territory. The Soviets filed a formal protest within days of the incident, and a standdown was ordered.\n\tFor nearly four years, the U-2 ranged over much of the world, but only sporadically over the Soviet Union. Soviet radar was so effective that each flight risk another protest, and another standdown. Clearly, some means had to be found to accelerate the initial operational capability for a less vulnerable successor to the U2. Fortunately, by the time Francis Gary Powers was shot down near Sverdlovsk on 1 May 1960 (fortunate for the intelligence community, that is — not for Powers), an alternative means of carrying out pornographic reconnaissance of the Soviet Union was approaching operational readiness. On 19 August 1960, just 110 days after the downing of the last U-2 overflight of the Soviet Union, the first successful air catch was made near Hawaii of a capsule exposed film ejected from a pornographic reconnaissance satellite that had completed seven passes over the night territory 17 orbits of the earth. The feat was the culmination of four years of intensive and often frustrating effort to build, launch, orbit, and recover an intelligence product from a camera-carrying satellite.\n\tAt about the time the U-2 first began overflowing the Soviet Union in 1956, the US Air Force was embarking on the development of a strategic reconnaissance weapons program employing orbiting satellites in a variety of collection configurations. The program, which was designated WS-117L, had its origins in 1946 when a requirement was placed on the RAND Corporation for a study of the technical feasibility of orbiting artificial satellites. The first real breakthrough had come in 1953 when the USAF Scientific Advisory Board reported that to the Air Staff that it was feasible to produce relatively small and lightweight thermonuclear warheads. As a result of that report, the ATLAS ICBM program was accorded the highest priority in the Air Force.\n\nTOP SECRET [crossed out]\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1",

Accordingly, General Operational Requirement No. 80 was levied in 1955 with the stated objective of providing continuous surveillance of pre-selected areas of the world to determine the status of a potential enemy's war-making capacity.\n\tThe Air Research and Development Command, which had inherited the RAND study program in 1953, assigned the satellite project to its Ballistic Missile Division. The development plan for WS-117L was approved in July 1956, and the program got underway in October 1958 with the awarding of a contract to the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation for the development and testing of the system under the program name [redacted area].\n\tThe planning for WS-117L contemplated a family of separate systems and subsystems employing satellites for the collection of photographic, [redacted area] and infrared intelligence. The program, which was scheduled to extend beyond 1985, was divided into three phases. Phase I, the THOR-boosted test series, was to begin in November 1958, Phase II, the ATLAS-boosted test series, was scheduled to begin in June 1959 with the objective of completing the transition from the testing phase to the operational phase and improving the capability of the ATLAS booster to launch heavy loads in the space. Phase III, the operational series, was to begin in March 1960 and was insist of three progressively more sophisticated systems: the Pioneer version parentheses photographic and [redacted], the Advanced version (photographic and [redacted]), and the Surveillance version (photographic, [redacted], and infrared). It was expected that the operational control of WS-117L would be transferred to the Strategic Air Command with the initiation of Phase III.\n\tIt was an ambitious and complex program that was pioneering in technical fields about with little was known. Not surprisingly, it had become apparent by the end of 1957 that the program was running behind schedule. It was also in trouble from the standpoint of security. The U-2 program was carried out in secret 1958 until May 1960. Its existence was no secret to the Soviets, course, but they chose to let her remain a secret to the general public (into most of the official community) rather than publicize it and thereby admit that they lacked the means of defending their airspace against the high-flying U-2. WS-117 L was undertaken as a classified project, but it's very size and the number of people involved made it impossible to conceal the existence of the program for long. Press soon began speculating on the nature of the program, correctly identifying it as involving military reconnaissance satellites, and referring to it as BIG BROTHER and SPY IN THE SKY. The publicity was of concern, because the development of WS-117L was begun in a period when the international political climate was hostile to any form of overflight reconnaissance.\n\tIt was against this background that the Presence Board of Consultants on One Intelligence Activities submitted its semi-annual report to the President on 24 October 1967. The Board noted in its report that it was aware of two\n\n2 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTOP SECRET [crossed out]",

One was a study that progress in the Central Intelligence Agency concerning the feasibility of a man reconnaissance aircraft design for greatly increased performance and reduced radar cross-section; the other was WS-117L. However, there appeared little prospect that either of these could produce operational systems earlier than mid-1959. The Board emphasized the need for an interim photo reconnaissance system and recommended that an early review be made of new developments in advanced reconnaissance systems to ensure that they were given adequate consideration and receives proper handling and the light of then-existing and future intelligence requirements. The Executive Secretary of the National Security Council and 28 October notified the Secretary of Defense and the Director of Central I guess the President had asked for a joint report from them on the status and the demand Intelligence that the President had asked for a joint report from them on the status of the advanced systems. Secretary Quarles responded on behalf of himself and Mr. Dulles on 5 December with a recommendation that, because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject, details on the new systems be furnished through oral briefings.\n\tAs a consequence, there are no official records and CIA's project CORONA files bearing dates between 5 December 1957 and 21 March 1958, but it is clear that major decisions were made and that important actions were undertaken during the period. In brief, it was decided that the photographic subsystem of WS-117L, designated Project CORONA, and placed under a joint CIA-Air Force management team — an approach that had been so successful in covertly developing and operating the U-2.\n\tThe nucleus of such a team was then constituted as the Development Projects Staff under the direction of Richard Bissell, who was Special Assistant to the DCI were Planning and Development. Bissell was designated as a senior CIA representative on the new venture, and his Air Force counterpart was Brigadier General Osmond Ritland, who, as Colonel Ritland had served as Bissell's 1st deputy in the early days of the Development Project Staff and later became Vice Commander of the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division.\n\tBissell recalls that he first learned of the new programming of the role intended for a minute \"in a not an informal way\" from Dr. Edwin Land. Dr. land had been deeply involved in the planning and development of the U-2 as a member of the Technological Capabilities Council of the Office of Defense Mobilization. He continued an active interest in overhead reconnaissance and later headed the Land Panel, which was formed in May 1958 to advise on the development of OXCART, the aircraft planned as the successor to the U-2. Bissell also recalls that his early instructions were extremely vague: that the subsystem was to be split off from WS-117L, that it was to be placed under separate covert management, and that the pattern established for the development of the U-2 was to be followed. One of the instructions, however, was firm and precise: none of the funds for the new program were to come from monies authorized for already approved Air Force programs. This restriction, although seemingly clear at 1st glance, but to the disagreement over its interpretation. CORONA management expected that the boosters already approved\n\n\nTOP SECRET [crossed out]\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                 3"

As a consequence, CIA had to go back to the President with the admission that the original project proposal had understated the estimated cost and with a request for more money.\n\tRoughly concurrent with the decision to place one of the WS-117L subsystems under covert management, the Department of Defense realigned its structure for the management of space activities. The Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) was established on 7 February 1958 and was granted authority for all military space projects. The splitting off of CORONA from WS-117L was accomplished by a directive from ARPA on 28 February 1958, assigning responsibility for the WS-117L program to the Air Force and ordering that the proposed WS-117L interim because the system employing THOR boost be dropped.\n\tThe ARPA directive ostensibly canceling the THOR-boosted interim reconnaissance satellite was followed by all of the notifications that would normally accompany the cancellation of a military program. The word was passed officially was in the Air Force, and formal contract cancellations were sent out to the prospective suppliers. There was much furore when the cancellations went out: contractors were furious over the suddenness of the action; Air Force personnel were thunderstruck at the abandonment of the WS-117L pornographic subsystem that seemed to have the best chance of early success. After the cancellation, very limited numbers of individuals in the Air Force and in the participating companies were cleared for Project CORONA and were informed of the procedures to be followed in the covert reaction of the canceled program.\n\t[Redacted area]\n\tAfter Bissell and Ritland had worked out the ranges for the [redacted area], they began tackling the technical problems associated with the design configuration they had inherited from WS-117L. The subsystem endpoint contemplated the use of the THOR IRBM as the first stage booster and, as a second  stage, Lockheed's modification of a rocket engine that had been developed by Bell Aircraft for takeoff assist and auxiliary power applications in the B-58 HUSTLER bomber. It was referred to as the HUSTLER engine during the development phase of WS-117L, but soon came to be known as the AGENA — the name it bears today.\n\tOne of the very early CORONA plans called for spin stabilization of the payload, with the camera scanning as the payload rotated.

Recognizing the need for resolution to meet the intelligence objectives, it was concluded that physical film recovery offered the most promising approach for usable photographic return in the interim time period. This resulted in the addition to the design of a recovery pot or capsule with General Electric selected as the recovery vehicle contractor. In retrospect, the decision on recovery would prove to be one of the most important made in the US reconnaissance activities, in that all 4 reconnaissance systems developed of to the current time have relied on physical recovery of film.\t\n\tAnother major decision for the new CORONA Program came in late March 1958, followed by a three-day conference in San Mateo, California, among representatives of CIA, Air Force Ballistic Missile Division, Lockheed, General Electric, and Fairchild. The discussion revealed that, while work was going forward, the design was far from complete. The senior Lockheed representative reported that they had investigated the possibility of building a satellite vehicle shaped like a football, a cigar, or a sphere. They had finally decided, for the original drawings at least, on a football -shaped pod slightly elongated at each end to correct the center of gravity. There was discussion of the need for immediate contractual arrangements with the various suppliers. Bissell remarked that he was \"faced with the problems at present of being broke\" and would need estimates from all the suppliers as soon as possible in order to obtain the necessary financing to get the program underway. The suppliers agreed to furnish the required estimates by the following week.\n\tThe project quickly began taking formal shape following that meeting. Within a span of about three weeks, approval of the program and of its financing was obtained, and the design of the payload configuration involved in a concept quite different from the spin-stabilized pod. It was at this point in late March and early April 1958 that major complications had arisen in the technical design of the Fairchild camera. Interest shifted to a competitive design submitted by the Itek Corporation, a spinoff of Boston University. Itek proposing longer forgo a camera scanning within an earth-center stabilized pod. The Itek design was based on the principle of the Boston University Hyak camera. Bissell recalls that he personally decided in favor of the Itek design, but only after much agonizing evaluation. The decision was a difficult one to make because it involved moving from a proven method of space vehicle stabilization to one that was technically more difficult to accomplish. It did, however, standardize on the 3-axis stabilization being pursued on the WS-117L  AGENA development, and which has been a part of all subsequent photo reconnaissance systems.\n\tBissel's first project proposal, which was completed on 9 April 1958 requested approval for concurrent development of both the Fairchild and the Itek systems, with the Fairchild configuration becoming operational first and the Itek configuration being developed as a follow-on system. Within two days, however, Bissel had made the final decision to abandon the Fairchild spin-stabilized configuration entirely. He rewrote the project proposal, taking note of the earlier\n\nTOP SECRET [crossed out]\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5",

The proposal was rewritten a second time, retaining the Itek configuration with raising the cost estimate from [redacted area] to [redacted area]. Of the total estimate the cost,[redacted area] represented \"a rather arbitrary allowance for 12 each THOR boosters and Lockheed second stage vehicles, and was to be financed by ARPA through the Air Force. The remaining [redacted area] was for [redacted area] by CIA of the pods containing the reconnaissance equipment and the recoverable film cassettes.\n\nThe final project proposal was forwarded to Brigadier General Andrew J. Goodpaster, the President's Staff Secretary, on 16 April 1958 after having been reviewed by Mister Roy Johnson and Admiral John Clark of ARPA; Mister Richard Horner, Assist Secretary of the Air Force for Research and Development; Brigadier General Osmond Ritland, Vice Commander, Air Force Ballistic Missile Division; and Doctor James Killian, Special Assistant to the President for Science and Technology. The proposal was approved, although not in writing. The only original record of the President's approval reportedly was in the form of a handwritten note on the back of an envelope by General C. P. Cabell, the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence.\n\nAlthough it may have been the original intent that CORONA would be administered in a manner essentially same as that of the U-2 program, it actually began and evolves quite differently. It was a joint CIA-ARPA-Air Force effort, much as the U-2 was a joint CIA-Air Force effort, but it lacks the central direction that characterized the U-2 program. The project proposal described the anticipated administrative arrangements, but it fell short of clarifying the delineation of authorities. It noted that CORONA was being carried out under the authority of ARPA and CIA with the support and participation of the Air Force. CIA's rules further explained in terms of participating in supervision of the technical developments, especially as regards the actual reconnaissance, handling all [redacted area]. The work statement prepared for Lockheed, the prime contractor, on 25 April 1958 noted merely that technical direction of the program was the joint responsibility of several agencies of the Government.\n\nThe imprecise statements of who was to do what connection with CORONA allowed for a range of interpretation. The vague assignments of responsibilities cause no appreciable difficulties in the early years of CORONA in the joint concern was primarily one of producing as promised, but they later (1963) became a source of severe friction between CIA and the Air Force responsibility for conducting the program.\n\nBissell, the recognized leader of the early CORONA program, gave this description of how the early program is managed:\n\tThe program was started in a marvelously informal manner. Ritland and I worked of the division of labor between the 2 organizations as we went along. Decisions are made jointly. There were so few people involved in their relations were so close that decisions could be and were made quickly and cleanly. We did not have the problem of having to make\n\n4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTOP-SECRET [crossed out]"

After we got fully organized in the contracts had been let, we began a system of management through monthly suppliers' meetings — as we had done with the U-2. Ritland and I sat at the end of the table, and I acted as Chairman. The group included 2 or 3 people from each of the suppliers. We heard reports of progress and ventilated problems — especially those involving interfaces among contractors. The program is handled in an extraordinarily cooperative manner between the Air Force and CIA. Also all the people involved on the Government side were more interested in getting the job done that in claiming credit for gaining control.\n\nThe schedule of the program, as it had been presented to the CORONA group at its meeting in San Mateo in late March 1958, call for a \"count-down\" beginning about 1 July 1958 and extending for a period of 19 weeks. It was anticipated that the equipment would be assembled, tested, and the first vehicle launched during Baptist 19-week period, which meant that the fabrication of the individual components would have hats to be completed by 1 July 1958. By the time Bissell submitted his project proposal some 3 weeks later, it had become apparent that the earlier tentative scheduling was unrealistic. Bissell noted in his project proposal that it was not yet possible to establish a firm schedule of delivery dates, but that it appeared probable that the first firing could be attempted no later than June 1959.\n\nIt is pertinent to note here that there was no expectation in 1958 that CORONA would still be operating over a decade later. The CORONA program got underway initially as an interim, short-term, high risk developments to meet the intelligence community's requirements area search photographic reconnaissance pending successful development of other, more sophisticated systems plan for WS-117L. The original CORONA proposal anticipated the acquisition of only 12 vehicles, noting that at a later date it might be desirable to consider whether the program should be extended — with or without further technological improvement.\n\nHaving settled on the desired configuration and having received Presidential approval of the program and its financing, the CORONA management team moved forward rapidly with the contractual arrangements. The team of contractors for CORONA differed from the team on the WS-117L subsystem as a consequence of selecting Itek's first-sensor stabilized approach. Itek was brought in as one of the 2 major subcontractors to Lockheed (General Electric being the other). However, to soften the financial blow to Fairchild, I check was made responsible for the design and development of the camera subsystem with Fairchild producing the camera on the subcontract to Itek. This contractor team continued throughout the CORONA program, although later in the program, the relationship was changed to that of associate contractors. The contractor relationships on the CORONA program were as friendly and cooperative is any that could have been set up, and his team dedication to the success of the program is one of the primary reasons for the success of the program enjoyed. The final contractors were selected on 25 April 1958 in the word statement was issued to Lockheed on that date. The contractors began system design on 28 April\n\nTOP-SECRET [crossed out]\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7",

The designs were frozen on 26 July.\n\n[Redacted area]\n\nBus, but mid-1958, the program was well down the road — on the contractors' site — toward meeting the goal of a first launch no later than mid-1959. The Government site, however, was running into difficulties. The first problem is money, the second was covered, and the two were inextricably intertwined. The [redacted area] cost estimate for the 12-vehicle program had assumed that the cost of the THOR boosters would be absorbed by the Air Force by diverting them from the canceled WS-117L subsystem. That assumption proved to be incorrect. An additional [redacted area] had to be found to pay for the 12 THORs. Further, it had been decided that an additional four launch vehicles would be required for testing of launch, orbit, and recovery procedures and that an additional three would be required for biomedical launches support of the CORONA cover story. ARPA could not see his way clear to making Defensed Department funds available really for testing or for cover support when there were other DoD space programs with pressing needs for money. Consequently, CORONA management had to go back to the President for approval of a revised estimate.\n\nBy August 1958, it had also become apparent to the project's managers that the original, but as yet unannounced, cover story conceived for the future CORONA launchings (an experimental program within the first face of WS-117L) was becoming increasingly untenable. WS-117L had by then become the subject of fairly widespread public speculation identifying it as a military reconnaissance program. It was feared that thinking CORONA to WS-117L in any way would inevitably place the reconnaissance label on CORONA, and — given the hostility of the international political climate to overflight reconnaissance — there was the risk that the policy level of government might cancel the program if it should be so identified. Some other story would have to be contrived that would dissociate CORONA from WS-117L and at the same time account for multiple launchings of stabilized vehicles in low polar orbits and with payloads being recovered from orbit.\n\nIt was decided, therefore, to separate the WS-117L photo reconnaissance program into two distinct and ostensibly unrelated series: one identified as\n\n8 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTOP-SECRET [crossed out]",

A press release announcing the  initiation of the  DISCOVER series was issued on 3 December 1958 identifying the initial launchings as tests of the vehicle itself and later launching as explorations of environmental conditions in spades. Biomedical specimens, including live animals, were to be carried into space and their recovery from orbit attempted.\n\n the new CORONA cover concept, from which the press release stems, call for a total of five biomedical vehicles, and three of the five were committed to the schedule under launching three, four, and seven. The first two were to carry mice and the third a primate. The two uncommitted vehicles were to be held in reserve in event of failure of the heavier primate vehicle. In further support of the cover plan, ARPA was to develop two radiometric payload packages designed specifically to study navigation of space vehicles and to obtain data useful in the development of an early warning system (the planned [ redacted area] infrared series).  it might be noted here that only one of the three plan animal-carrying missions was actually attempted (as DISCOVERER III), and it was a failure. ARPA did develop the radiometric payload packages, and they were  launched as DISCOVERERS XIX and XXI in late 1960 and early 1961.\n\n The photo reconnaissance mission of CORONA necessitated a near-polar orbit, I like you either to the north or to the south. There are a few otherwise suitable areas in the continental United States for this can be done without danger that   debris  from an early in-flight failure could fall into populated areas. Cooke Air Force Base* near California's Point  Arguello met the requirement for down-range safety, because the trajectory of a southward launch from there would be over the Santa Barbara Channel and the Pacific Ocean beyond. Cooke was a natural choice, because it was the site of the first airport operational missile training base and also housed the 672nd Strategic Missile Squadron (THOR). two additional factors favor this as the launch area: the manufacturing facilities and skilled personnel required were in the near vicinity, a southward launch would permit recovery in the Hawaii area by initiating the injection\/recovery sequence as the satellite  passed over the Alaskan tracking facility.\n\n Unlike the U-2 flights, launchings of satellites from US soil simply could not be concealed from the public. Even a booster as small as the THOR (small, that is, in comparison with present-day space boosters) launches with a thunderous roar that can be heard for miles; the space vehicle transmit telemetry that can be intercepted; and the vehicle can be detected in orbit by radar skin-track. the fact of the launch could not be concealed, but maintenance of the cover story for the DISCOVERER series required that the launchings of the uniquely configured photographic payload be closed to observation by  unwitting personnel. Vandenberg was  excellent as a launch site for many standpoints, but it had one feature that posed a severe handicap to screening the actual launches from unwanted observation: the heavily traveled Southern Pacific Railroad passes through it.

Throughout  its existence, the CORONA program at Vandenberg was plagued by having to time the launches to occur during one of the intervals between passing trains.\n\n The plan recovery sequence involved a series of maneuvers, each of which had to be executed to near-perfection or recovery would fail. Immediately after reduction into orbit, the AGENA vehicle was yawed 180 degrees so that the recovery vehicle faced to the rear. This maneuver minimized the control gas which would be required for reentry orientation at the end of the mission, and protected the heat shield from molecular heating, a subject of considerable concern at that time. (Later in the J-3 design when these concerns had diminished, the vehicle would be flown forward until reentry.) When reentry was to take place, the AGENA would  then be pitched down through 60 degrees to position the satellite recovery vehicle (SRV) for retro-firing. Then the SRV would be separated from the AGENA and be spin-stabilized by firing the spin rockets to maintain it in the attitude given it by the AGENAperiod next the retro-rocket would be fired, slowing down the SRV into a  descent trajectory. then the spin of the SRV would be slowed by firing the de-  spin rockets. Next would come the separation of the retro-rocket thrust cone followed by the heatshield and the parachute cover. The drogue (or deceleration)  chute would then deploy, finally the man she would open to lower the capsule gently into the recovery area. The primary recovery technique involved flying an airplane across the top of the descending parachute, catching the chute or its shrouds in a trapeze-like hook suspended beneath the airplane and then winching the recovery vehicle aboard. C-119 Aircraft were initially used with C-130 aircraft replacing them later in the program. The recovery vehicle was designed to float long enough, if the air catch failed, for a water recovery by helicopter launch from a surface ship.\n\nWhile the vehicle was still in the construction stage, tests of the air recovery technique were conducted by the 6593rd Test Squadron — with disheartening results. Of 94 drops using personnel-type chutes, only 49 were recovered. Using one type of operational drop chute, only four were recovered out of 15 drops, and an average of 1.5 aircraft passes were required for the hookup. Eleven drops with another type of operational chute resulted in five recoveries in an average of two aircraft passes for the snatch. Part of the difficulty lay in weak chutes and rigging, and in crew inexperience. the most serious problem, however, was the  fast drop rate of the chutes. parachutes that were available to support the planned weight of the recovery vehicle at a sink rate of about 33 feet per second. What was required was a sink rate approaching 20 feet per second so that the aircraft would have time to make three or four passes if necessary for hookup. Fortunately, by the time space hardware was ready for launching,\n______________\n\n*The early THOR-AGENA combination limited film to enough for a 24 our mission of 17 orbits, seven of which with cross denied territory.

The countdown was started for a  launch on the 21st; however, the attempt aborted at  launch minus 60 minutes. When power was applied to test the AGENA hydraulic system, certain events took place that were supposed to occur in flight but not while the vehicle was still sitting on the launch pad. The explosive bolts connecting the AGENA  to the THOR detonated, and the ullage rockets *  fired. The AGENA  settled into the fairing attaching it to the THOR  and did not fall to the ground, but appreciable damage was done.\n\n A program review conference was held in Palo Alto two  days after the launch failure to examine the possible causes of the abort  and to assess its impact on the planned CORONA launch schedule. Fortunately, the problem was but we identified and easily corrected, and it was felt that the system is ready for test launches at the rate of about one per month.\n\n At the review conference, General Electric surfaced a new problem having to do with the stability of the nosecone during reentry. The cone was designed for a film loan of 40 pounds, but the 1st missions would be able to carry only 20 pounds. GE reported that about three pounds of balance would have to be carried in the forward end of the colon to restore stability. the program officers decided to add an instrument package as ballast, either for diagnostic purposes or for support of the biomedical cover story, thus converting what could have been dead weight into a net plus for the test program.\n\n The test plan contemplated arriving at full operational capability at a relatively early date through sequential testing of the major components of the system — beginning with the THOR-AGENA combination alone, then adding the nosecone to test the ejection\/reentry\/recovery sequence, and finally installing a camera for a full CORONA systems test. Just how much confidence the project planners had in the imminence of success cannot now be discovered; however, if the confidence factor was very high the start, it must soon have begun to wane. Beginning in February 1959 and extending through June 1960 and even dozen launches were attempted, with 8 of the vehicles carrying cameras, and all of them were failures; no film capsules were recovered from orbit, of the eight camera-carrying vehicles, four failed to achieve orbit, three experienced camera  or film failures, and the eighth was not recovered because of a malfunction of the reentry body spin rockets. These summaries of the initial launch attempts illustrate the nature and dimensions of the problems for which solutions had to be found.\n_____________\n* Ullage rockets are small solid propellant rockets attached to the AGENA. These rockets are fired just prior to ignition of the AGENA\n engine after its separation from the THOR to ensure that the liquid AGENA propellants are pushed against the bottom of the tank so that proper flow into the palms will occur.",

DISCOVERER I was launched on 28 February 1959 with a light engineering payload as a test of THOR-AGENA performance. No recovery was planned. For a time there was uncertainty as to what had happened to it because no radio signals were received. At the time, it was believed to have obtained orbit with speculation that the protective nosecone over the antennas was ejected just before the AGENA fired and that the AGENA then  rammed into the nosecone, damaging the antennas.  today, most people believe the DISCOVERER I landed somewhere near the South Pole.\n\n DISCOVER II\n\n The second vehicle was lost on 13 April 1959. Orbit was officially announced about two hours later, along with a statement that the capsule carried a lightweight biomedical payload  (as indeed it did). The Air Force reported on 15 April that plans to recover the capsule near Hawaii had been abandoned and that the capsule might descend somewhere in the Arctic.  the announcement slightly understated the known facts.  the capsule had ejected on the 17th orbit is planned, but a timing malfunction (actually a human programming error) that caused the ejection sequence to be initiated too early. The capsule was down, probably somewhere in the near-vicinity of the Spitsbergen Islands north of Norway. In fact, there were later reports that the falling capsule had actually been seen by Spitsbergen residents. The Air Force announced on the 16th that the Norwegian government had authorized a search for the capsule which would begin the following day. Planes scoured the area, and helicopters join the search on the 20th. Nothing was found, however, and the search was abandoned on the 23rd. [Redacted area]\n\n DISCOVER III\n\nMuch publicity attended the launching of DISCOVER III: some of it planned in some unplanned (and unwanted). This was the 1st (and only) DISCOVERER flight to carry animals: four live black mice. Black mice were chosen in order to ascertain the possible  hair-bleaching effects of cosmic rays. The mice were members of the C-57 strain, a particularly rugged breathing. They had been \"trained, along with 60 other mice, at the Air Force's  Aeromedical Field Laboratory at Holloman  AFB. They were 7 to 10 weeks old and\n____________\n*  The incident inspired a book by Alastair McLean,  Ice Station Zebra, and a 1968 movie of the same name, but the fictional version gave little cause for concern that some CORONA alumnus was serving as technical consultant.

Special agents on board are after a missing capsule with coverage of all US missile sites, snapped by a Soviet satellite equipped with a stolen US camera.

The panic was, and troubleshooters were sent up to check. They found that when the vehicle was in a vertical position the humidity sensor was directly beneath the cages, and did not distinguish between plain water and urine. The wetness dried out after a while, all was forgiven, and the vehicle was launched — unhappily into the permanent 100 percent moisture environment of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nAlso, the timing of the launch was on fortune. The monkeys, Able and Acre, had survived a 300-mile flight in a UBER nosecone on 29 May in connection with another, unrelated test program. However, able died during minor surgery in 3 June to remove an electrode that have been implanted under his skin. (This was the date of the DISCOVER III launch.) The British Society against Cruel Sports made a formal protest to the U.S. ambassador, and the rest raised a quick stink about a fatal mice flight — comparing it unfavorably to the Russians of possibly successful launching of the dog, Laika, in SPUTNIK II back in November 1970, and demanding that orbit and recovery sieges the perfect before attempting further launches of mice or monkeys.\n\nDISCOVERERS IV-VIII \n\nDISCOVER IV on 25 June 1959 was the first to carry a camera and thus a true CORONA test, but the payload did not go into orbit.

Mitchell was decorated with the Distinguished Flying Cross, and members of his group were awarded the Air Medal for their accomplishments.\n\nThe film was flown to the [ redacted area] for development and was then delivered to PIC (now known as NPIC) for readout and reporting. The resolution was substantially lower than  that obtainable from the U-2, but the photography had intelligence value, and it covered areas of the USSR which the U-2 had never reached. this one satellite mission, in fact, yielded photo coverage of a greater area than the total produced by all the U-2 missions over the  Soviet Union. The only major deficiencies in the photography were plus and minus density bars running diagonally across the format. Some were due to minor light leaks, and others were the result of electrostatic discharge known as corona. these marks show that the program security officer had had great insight when he named the program. There are two types of corona markings, a glow which caused the most difficulty, and a dendritic discharge which is more spectacular in appearance.\n\n A press release announced the success of the mission but naturally made no mention of the real success: the delivery of  photographic intelligence. The announcement noted that the satellite had been placed into an orbit with a 77.6 degree of inclination, an apogee of 502 miles, a perigee of 116 miles, and an orbital period of 94.5 minutes. A retro-rocket had slowed the capsule to reentry velocity, and a parachute had been released at 60,000 feet. The capsule, which weighed 84 pounds at recovery, was caught at 8500 feet by a C 119 airplane on its third pass over the falling parachute.\n\n Progress in Problems\n\n The program officers did not take the success of DISCOVERER XIV to mean that there problems with the system were at an end, but many of the earlier  difficulties had been surmounted. The orbital injection technique had been improved to a level at which vehicles were repeatedly put into orbit with injection angle errors of less than 4\/10 of a degree. The timing of the initiation of the recovery sequence had been so refined that ejection of the DISCOVERER XI SRV occurred within 5 seconds of the planned time. Parachute deceleration and air catch of the capsule had been accomplished repeatedly with test capsules dropped from high altitude balloons. The last two cameras placed in orbit had operated well.\n\n there were other critical problems, however, that remained to be solved. Foremost among them at the time was that of consistently achieving the correct retro-velocity and angle of reentry of the recovery vehicle. The DISCOVERER\n______________\n*Mitchell had been patrolling the primer recovery zone for  DISCOVERER XIII, which was fish from the water by a recovery ship after Mitchell's plane missed it. The Air Force pride stung, assigned Mitchell to the boondocks some 500 miles down range for DISCOVERER XIV. The capsule overshot the primary recovery area, where three aircraft were chasing the wrong radar blip.  when Mitchell 1st tried to report his catch, he was told to keep off the air in order not to interfere with the recovery operation.\n\n 22                                                                                                            TOP SECRET [ crossed out]"

Using recovered hardware from the last flight, developmental models of the J-3 program, and photographic records from the memorable flights, a classified museum  display was set up in Washington, D.C. In his speech dedicating the Museum, Mr. Richard Helms, the Director of Central Intelligence said:\n\nIt was confidence in the ability of intelligence to monitor Soviet  compliance with the commitments that enabled President Nixon to enter into the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and to sign the Arms Limitation Treaty. Much, but by no means all, of the intelligence necessary to verify so in compliance with  SALT will come from photo reconnaissance satellites. CORONA, the program which pioneered the way in satellite reconnaissance, deserves a place in history which we are preserving through this small Museum display.\n\n \"A Decade of Glory,\" as the display is entitled, must for the present remain classified. We hope, however, that as the world grows  to  accept satellite reconnaissance, it can be transferred to the Smithsonian Institution. Then the American public can view this work, and then the men of  CORONA, like the Wright Brothers, can be recognized for the role they played in the shaping of history.\n\n\n37",

MURPHY:    The various leases Mr. Davis secured from Mr. Gilliat.\n\nTHE WITNESS:   Mr. Murphy, I think all that Mr. Davis got were the dates from Mr. Gilliat and their office records.     I have the least [lease] at Volta Place.\n\nMR. MURPHY:    No. I am not interested in that.    I am interested in the leases that Mr. Gilliat has advised us he gave to Mr. Davis.\n\nMR. CROSS:    Well, whatever we have is at the office, but they will be here in 15 minutes if you can pass it.    I did not know this was going to be asked for this morning.\n\nQ    Am I correct in recalling that at the time you discussed with Mr. Chambers the possibility of leasing to him your 28th Street apartment you had spoken to him only three times before that?     A I would not be sure.    It was somewhere in that neighborhood.\n\nQ    As I recall your testimony you said the first time you met him was in late December or early January of 1935; that is late 1934 or early 1935 when you were with the Nye Committee?       A That is correct."

I believe that that was included in.  They were in my name:  they continued in my name, and I think they were just part  of the arrangement.\nQ  In other words, you were obligated to pay for the gas and electric yourself, and you did not exact from him any promise to pay or to reimburse you tor those costs?\nA  That is my best recollection.  I don't recall making a special arrangement about that.\nQ  Whether you recall it nor not, the fact is that you paid for the electricity and for the gas?\nA  Yes, and, of course, for the rent on the apartment too to the landlord.\nQ  We are going over these things separately now:  we are agreed that you paid for the rent that you were obligated to pay?  A.  Right.\nQ  That you gave him the use of the furniture for which you did not charge?  A  Yes.\nQ  You also paid and he did not assume to pay the cost for the electricity and for the gas?  A.  That is my best recollection after all these years.\nQ  And can we add to that the cost of the phone?"

I am sure that if he had had any long distance call of any magnitude I would have expected him to pay for that.\nQ    So, then, to sum it up, we have an arrangement whereby you leased an apartment furnished for the same rent that you were paying unfurnished?    A. Yes.\nQ    And that you sort of threw in free gas, free electricity and free phone?   A    If you want to call it \"throw in.\"    I would think it was included.\nQ   Well, he was not obligated, as you remember it, to pay for any of those utilities?    A    I have no recollection of asking him specifically to cover those, that is correct.\nQ    And then to come to the next matter, the arrangement was oral and not in writing?    A    Yes, I am confident it was oral.\nQ   You never had any doubts that it was oral, did you?\nA   Did I have any doubts?    No, I am sure it was an oral arrangement.\nQ   At that time it was 1935, and you have been a lawyer for six years?    A   Yes, sir.\nA   You had been a lawyer admitted to the bar in Massachusetts and New York? A   Yes\nQ   And you were then acting as an associate general counsel for the Government in Washington?

A  I think in every case the experience was that the landlord asked for rent in advance.\nQ   Asked for and received?

A Well, except for the gift of a rug which I think was sort of part payment, that is correct.\nQ   Well, let us talk now about the rug.  That was given to you according to your testimony, when you were living on P Street?   A  Yes, sir, that is correct.\nQ   And I think you fix the time somewhere around May or June of 1936?    A   Oh, I am not sure of the date. I would think it might be a little earlier that that, some time in the spring of 1936.   We did not have it at P Street very long.   That is my recollection.\nQ  That was a considerable time after Mr. Chambers' sublease had expired.   A  Yes.\nQ  His sublease expired on the 1st of July or the 30th of June, 1935?

A  Yes.\nQ  Nine or ten months later when you received a rug from him when you were living at P Street, and you say"

A  Yes, that is correct.\nQ    Well, in connection with that did you consider it an overpayment or an underpayment?   A    I considered it an inadequate payment.   I didn't think it, from my point of view, took the place of the money he owed me.\nQ    What did you think the rug was worth in dollars at that time?    A    I don't think I have ever made an estimate of its value.\nQ    Wouldn't you have to make some sort of a mental estimate in order to determine whether it was an adequate or an inadequate payment for the money he owed you?\nA    No, I was thinking of its usefulness to me, Mr. Murphy. That is what I meant.\nQ    Let us suppose it had been a diamond; would you also have considered that an inadequate payment?\nA   I don't know that I can answer that hypothetically.\nQ    Well, in any event you thought, no matter what the value was, it was inadequate because you couldn't readily use it?    A    It was not my choice.    It was not what I would of liked to have had.   I would rather have had the payment in cash.\nQ    Had you pressed him for the payment?

That is the best I can recall.\n\nQ   And I think you were not too sure whether or not that was the time you met Mrs. Chambers?\n\nA   I don't recall her coming to the apartment.   I don't doubt she did.   But I don't recall meeting her until they came to the P Street house.\n\nQ   How long would you say that inspection lasted?   How long were you there?   Do You remember?\n\nA   How long was he there?\n\nQ   Yes.   You also had lived with him, didn't you - weren't you then living in P Street?\n\nA   No, I think he came to the 28th Street apartment before we had moved away.   That is my recollection.

I do not.\n\nQ   Would you want to tell us how long the visit took?\n\nA   I would hesitate to say how long.\n\nQ  They appeared to be satisfied anyway?   A  Yes.   They must have stayed an hour or so.\n\nQ   At that time, or up to that time, had you discussed with him at all his background?\n\nA   I cannot remember when I first heard him talk about his own experiences and his background, but some time perhaps during lunch meetings.   I cannot place the first time, Mr. Murphy.\n\nQ   Tell us what he told you about some of those experiences.\n\nA   Well, he said he had travelled a good deal; that he had taken various jobs for local color as a writer; trips of the kind that Jack London and Tim Tully, the authors, had taken out through the West and in the Middle West, and he said he travelled abroad a good deal.   It seems he had been most everywhere.\n\nQ   Well. you had been abroad twice up to that time, had you not?\n\nA   Yes.\n\nQ   Did you -- I think on your direct testimony you only told us about one trip?\n\nA   Yes."

I had never been to Germany and I am quite sure he told me he had, and I think he told me he had been to Ireland and I had never been to Ireland.\nQ   You did not discuss the other parts of Europe where you had both been?

A  No, I am quite sure he did not tell me that.\nQ  You gathered, I take it, he had some educational background?   A  I had the impression he was rather self-taught, as a matter of fact.\nQ   Prior to the leasing of the apartment had you discussed much of your own personal life with him?\nA    I really do not know.\nQ  Well, we can almost eliminate the first time, can't we?   A  Yes.\nQ   I think you told us that the first three visits were devoted almost exclusively to the Nye Committee and its investigations?   A  Yes, I think so.   We always talked about the Nye Committee some time in the course of our conversations.  That I am sure of.\nQ   About this time you were examining Mr. Bernard"

A   He was.  He was the Secretary and sometimes called Chief Investigator.\nA  And if he was sometimes called Chief Investigator and you worked under him, you might, perchance, have been called Investigator?

A  That is my recollection of what he told me.\nQ   And when do you think that was in point of time?\nA   I think it was shortly after we had moved to P Street and I would not be able to fix it exactly.  It\nwas the date he had fixed to move into the 28th Street apartment, some time after we left.  It might have been as late as the first of May or more likely I think the latter part of April.\nQ   Would you say it would be somewhere close to the end or beginning of the month?  A  I would think it was close to the first of May.\nQ   And that was the time where you received a phone call from him, or your wife, saying that they were there\nand they could not move in and they were sort of just stuck, is that correct?   A  Either a phone call  or he came to the house.   I think it was a phone call.   I am not sure of the details, Mr. Murphy, but I do remember the substance of what he said.\nQ   But in any event they made some representation they could not move in because their belongings had not arrived?   A  That is correct.\nQ   They were delayed in some way and you think the van"

A  Yes.\nQ   I think you told us there were beds and chairs and some living room furniture?   A  I am not sure whether\nwe took our son's bed with us.  We left our double bed, but I am not sure whether we took the boy's bed, but certainly the apartment was left well furnished.\nQ   And even though the apartment was left well furnished they represented to you and your wife that they could not, in fact, move in because their furniture had not arrived?\nA   Well, their furnishings or furniture.    We had not left china and silverware and kitchenware and things of that sort.   We did not have enough to go around for two establishments on that.\nQ   Did anybody suggest perhaps they could buy a cup and saucer or knife and fork and move in?   A  Not that I recall.

You tell us the apartment as you remember it was pretty well furnished.  Those are your words?   A  That is right.   We took some lamps with us over to P Street and a few other things, but it was left quite well furnished.\nQ   Now, when they stayed at the P Street house it is your testimony that they stayed about two nights and possibly three?

In other words, I remember various stories that Mr. Crosley told me; the one about having worked on the first street railway in"

He said he worked on the first street railway in Washington as a laborer in order to get local color, and I thought that was kind of a tall story because I thought the street railways were older than that.   Whether he told me that while staying at P Street or whether that was later I just can't recall the conversations of that particular time, Mr. Murphy.\nQ   You did not tell us that story about the Washington street railways because Mr. Chambers on questioning in his Baltimore deposition told about that?   A   No. \nQ   You tell us that because they are facts as you knew them in 1935?   A  I told this to the House Committee before he ever talked about it as one of the stories I remembered his telling me.\nQ   Now you say that it was at this time that Mrs. Chambers painted a picture of your stepson?     A Yes.   She painted a picture, not a finished picture, just a picture \nof Timmy.\nQ   We are agreed, are we not, that it was an oil painting?   A   That is my recollection of it.   I am not absolutely positive.   I think it was an oil painting, yes. \nQ   Didn't you tell us at the last trial that it was, in fact, an oil painting?   A   I would have told you whatever I recalled and I think it was an oil painting. \nQ  And was it the head of the child or bust?"

I do remember distinctly that she painted a picture of Timmy and it was the first time and only time he ever had his picture painted and he was pretty excited about it himself. \nQ   Was it on canvas or board?     A  I cannot remember that.  I would not remember how big it was. \nQ   Do you know how long it took her to paint it? \nA   No, sir.   It was done, I think, during the day while I was away, probably just to occupy her time and as a kindness to us.\nQ   You say the boy rather liked it?    A   Yes. \nQ   And you cannot tell us whether it took a day or two or more to paint it?   A  No. \nQ   Can you --    A   I am sorry I cannot tell you how large it was and I cannot tell you how long it took, but I doubt if she spent very much time on it because a child \nthat young does not sit still very long.\nQ   If the child does not sit still very long, perhaps she spent a great deal of time on it?   A    You mean all told?\nQ   Yes.    A    Over a period of time, yes. \nQ   You cannot tell us the shape, whether oval or square or oblong or whether on canvas or board?    A  I am pretty sure it was not oval.  I don't think I have seen \none oval.  I could not tell you more about it. \nQ  Do you remember the predominant color?   A   No, sir."

What do you mean by a \"finished picture\"?  A    It was not a picture that by my taste was completed and attractive.  We did not save it.

A   I guess so.\nQ   So I am trying to find out what you mean by not a finished picture.  The attractiveness would not be a test, would it?    A   No, I guess not. \nQ   What do you think was lacking in it?    A   I just had the impression it was not completed.  It was a sketch, something she did while she was there. \nQ   A sketch in oils?    A    I think it was.   She may have considered she finished it.  I really don't know. \nQ   Did she use a pallet, do you know?    A    No, sir, I don't remember. \nQ   What equipment did they bring with them when they moved into your house for two or three days?   A  That I don't know either.  I don't remember. \nQ   Did they bring a change of clothes?    Did they have bags with clothing?   A   I am quite sure they did.

I did go to the eastern shore the weekend, Saturday and Sunday, after we were \nmarried and stayed at my aunt's farm.

I was then shopping for a new car.\nQ  In other words, this man to whom you made an oral lease at the base rental, although a furnished apartment, and who was not obligated to pay for gas, electricity or\nphone, and whom you had no idea who he was other than the name he told you - you promised him a Ford automobile when you bought your new car?    A  I said he could have it.    I don't know whether I could call it an actual promise.  I told him we were getting a new car, hoped to get it very soon.\nQ  You considered that a promise, didn't you?    A  Yes, I did.\nQ  And I take it he did?   A  That I don't know.\nQ  Well, he subsequently took it, didn't he?    A  He subsequently got it, yes, sir.\nQ  So that in April or May you told him that he could  have this old Ford of yours?  \nA   Yes.   He, as I remember it, said that he wondered if he could get a rented car, a drive-\nit-yourself car, while he was there to take his family out in the country weekends, and so on, and I told him that I would let him have the old Ford when I got a new car.\nQ  Not let him have it; you were going to give it to  him?   A  Yes, that is what I meant."

Would he telephone you or come over to P Street?   \nA   I don't remember, Mr. Murphy.  He may, for example, have used the car to drive his family and his overnight things to the apartment when they left P Street.   I just don't remember, but I do know I lent it to him a couple of times while he was on 28th Street.\nQ  Well, did you have the car in front of your house on P Street?   A  I kept it parked right in front of the house or near the house on P Street.\nQ  And I take it that either you or Mrs. Hiss kept the keys?   A  Yes.\nQ  So that each time he wanted it he would have to get the keys from either one of you?  A  Well, we could have left it with the maid and told him to pick it up.

I may be wrong in my recollection\nQ  Well, at what point along that period of time did you actually divest yourself of the old Ford to Chambers?\nA  Some time in the fall; whether it would be September or October, after we had come back from our vacation.   Chambers borrowed the old Ford for a couple of months.\nQ  When he borrowed the car I take it that you gave him the certificate of title?  A  I think I gave it to him at that time, Mr. Murphy.   I may not have given it to him until the early spring when he picked it up for good.  I think I gave it to him at that time as evidence that he had a right to be using it.\nQ  \"At that time,\" you are talking about the time when you gave him the car for good or when he borrowed it for a couple of months?  A   I was talking about two different times.  The time when he borrowed it in the fall for a couple of months.\nQ  At that time was it that you gave him the certificate of title?    A  I say I think so, Mr. Murphy, though I may not have given it to him until he picked the car up"

Yes.\nQ   Can you tell this jury whether or no you had liability insurance in Washington?    A   I know that I have had liability insurance in Washington, but just how early I took it out I don't know.   I think I have had it all the time, but I wouldn't want to say without checking, Mr. Murphy.\nQ   What is the name of the company that you had it with?    A   Well, the company that I now have it with I am sure I did not start in right away.   I don't recall their name immediately.   It is a French name.   They are in Washington.   I will probably be able to think of it in the course of the morning.\nQ   Are you thinking now of the name of the company or the name of the agency or broker?    A   The broker.\nQ   And you think that you had insurance on the Ford automobile to insure you against personal liability in the event of an accident in 1935?    A   Personal liability, yes, that is just what I think I had.    I know I had it in Boston because it was compulsory in Massachusetts.    I am not absolutely sure that I had it in Washington at that time.\nQ  In 1935 you hadn't lived in Boston for six years?\nA   That is right, but I had had the Ford up there."

A   Yes.\nQ   And unfortunately you haven't got those check stubs?    A   That is right.\nQ   You can't tell us the name of the agency or broker that you might have done business with?    A   Well, I will have to look it up.    I don't carry it in my mind at the moment.\nQ   Where would you look for it?    A   Well, I had an insurance man here in New York when I was living in New York, and I would look in my files to get his name.\nQ   You think a New York insurance broker would be the key to the Washington broker?    A   Yes, I think so.\nQ   Well, if you had insurance did you tell the insurance company in the fall of 1935 that you were no longer the owner of the car so that you wouldn't have to pay the premium?

Government's Exhibit 49 is the certificate of title, and when you say the balance was blank as you remember it you are referring to the reassignment and the purchaser's application?    A   Yes, everything under Marvin Smith's signature I feel confident that was all blank.\nQ   And you filled in the name Cherner Motor Company?    A    Yes.\nQ   With the address 1781 Florida Avenue?    A   Yes.\nQ   And you had your signature taken before Mr. Smith on the 23rd of July, 1936?    A   That is correct.\nQ   Was that before or after you moved out of P Street?\nA   After.\nQ   Was it before or after you moved into 30th Street?\nA   After.\nQ   You had lived in a hotel a short while during that"

Now you say he came back after a few months and said that he didn't want to use it any more? \nA   It is my recollection, Mr. Murphy, I may be wrong about it, but it is my recollection that when he picked it up in the fall he said he only wanted to use it for a couple of months and would bring it back, and would I keep it during the winter.   I am not sure of the conversation, but I don't think of it in terms of his having taken it for good in October and then coming back a couple of months later and saying would I then keep it for him.\nQ   And by keeping it he meant and you meant keeping it on the street?\nA   Being responsible for seeing that it was parked and kept --\nQ   Parked on the street.\nA   And kept in running order and so on.     I would start it in the winter and keep the battery from going down and get the tires pumped up every now and then, and things of that sort.\nQ   You mean during the winter of 1935 you would obligate yourself to turn the motor over, see that the batteries were filled? \nA   Every couple of weeks we had the problem of not getting a parking ticket for leaving it too long in one spot. It was kind of a nuisance to have to keep it going."

But that was at a time when you had already given it to Mr. Chambers?\nA   Yes, the way I have described it, Mr. Murphy.\nMR. CROSS:   Mr. Murphy, I don't want to interrupt, but the leases that you requested have been received together with two letters from the office of Gilliat & Company addressed to Mr. John F. Davis, one dated September 15, 1948, and the other dated September 17, 1948, and I think all the leases included in both letters are there.   We have some other leases but I think they are all duplicates.\nThere was also brought over some insurance papers that may, if you want to show them to Mr. Hiss, enable him to testify directly about the points that your were inquiring about.   They are here if you want them.\nMR. MURPHY:  These leases, with one exception, the leases that you hand me all refer either to Volta Place or to 30th Street.   Do you have any others?"

CROSS:  Here are the only two letters that I have been handed from Gilliat & Company to Mr. Davis enumerating all the leases enclosed, and I have checked them personally and they are all there.     If there are any others I will try to find out, but as I understand it those are the only ones we got.\nTHE WITNESS:  Perhaps I can help you, Mr. Murphy.   Mr. Gilliat was not the agent we used for P Street or for the 28th Street apartment.   I think he may have been for the O Street house, but that I am not sure of.\n[marginalia] slon 7\nQ   Do you know where the lease is for the P Street house?\nA  That is what I was telling you about before.   It is my understanding that Mr. Davis was told by Sandoz that they did not have a copy of that lease, and was told the same thing by whatever agent we went to for the 28th Street apartment.   I don't remember the name of that agency.   It was, I think Hagner.\nQ   Can we say, and then go on to something else, that you have not seen the original or copy of the P Street lease in many years? \nA   That is right, and I don't think I have seen even the 30th Street lease that Mr. Cross just produced.   I did not realize Mr. Gilliat had sent that one up.\nMR. CROSS:  Well, do you want to use these?    I want the record to show that we produced"

(Examining.)   I have no doubt that they were all typed by Mrs. Hiss - excuse me, there is one exception.  This was typed by her sister, Daisy Fansler, to the librarian; but the others I am sure were typed by Mrs. Hiss.\nQ   And those that were typed by Mrs. Hiss were typed on that machine there (indicating)?\nA   I have no doubt they were typed on that very machine.\nMR. CROSS:  Mr. Murphy, there is one there that Mr. Hiss said he thought she did not type.   Will you identify which one that is for the record?\nMR.

I don't have any recollection of seeing him there while he was my tenant.\nQ    Well, was it at the time that he actually agreed to rent the premises; that is, the day that he came to inspect them, that you took him or Mrs. Chambers and introduced them to the superintendent, Mrs. Jeffreys?\nA    To Mrs. Jeffreys, who lived downstairs, yes.\nQ   And you did that in order to ensure the right of the Chambers to keep their baby carriage under the front stairs, is that right?\nA   That was just one of the things.

You can't tell us?  A  I don't recall specifically.  I am confident I must have known when they left.\nQ  And when they left they owed you for the rent?\nA  Yes, sir.\nQ  And you had not received it?  A  I had not.  Never have.\nQ  Did you ask for it then?  A  I did not at that time as far as I recall.\nQ  Now, you think you remember that he told you they were going to Baltimore?  A  That is pretty close to my recollection, yes.  I think he told me.  It may have been an impression from something he said.  He may not expressly have said it.\nQ  Did you ever inquire where in Baltimore?\nA  No.\nQ  Well, at that time they had owed you for the rent; they had left without paying;  you assume that you knew that he went to Baltimore; nevertheless you made no efforts to find out where in Baltimore?\nA  No, that is correct."

I am afraid I have not made myself clear.    I think he told me when he took it in October he only wanted it for a couple of months at that time.     I think that was when he first took it.\nQ   So when he brought it back after the couple of months he might not have been seen.    In any event he left the keys and left the certificate?\nA   I don't think he left the certificate.    I think he kept the certificate.    I may be wrong on that.\nQ  In other words, there is a possibility during these winter months that the car stayed outside and was moved from one place to another every couple nights to avoid tickets, you did not have the certificate?\nA   Yes.    I think he must have left the registration card, but I frankly don't remember anything except I had the car all that winter.\nQ   And then you saw him again next when?\nA   Some time in the spring.\nQ  That is when he brought the rug?\nA   Yes.

A  Yes.\n\nQ   The house is P Street?     A  Yes, sir. \n\nQ   All right.    Now how many times after that did you see him?    A   I would hesitate to be absolutely positive. \nI don't think I saw him more than twice after that.  I think I saw him when he came to pick up the car, and whether I saw him one final occasion I am not sure.  I am not clear whether it was the same time he picked up the car that he asked for another small loan and I said I was tired of it, or whether that was a later occasion, or even whether that was over the telephone.    I am not sure whether I saw him \nonce or twice, and I might have seen him three times.   I am not absolutely sure.\n\nQ   Can we say at the outside three times?\n\nA  I would certainly think at the outside, but my recollection is not more than twice and maybe only the time he picked up the car. \n\nQ   And on one of those occasions, at least the last one, was the time you thought it best that you shall not see each other any more? \n A   Yes.

We had to get some curtains, \nand so on.\n\nQ   Did you accompany your wife on these purchases for those specific items?    A   These particular ones, Mr. Murphy?

A   On the occasion of  his one or two returns to this country I saw him.\n\nQ   And they would be what years, approximately? \n\n A  Oh, sometime -- I don't think he came back until after the war, but I am not absolutely sure. \n\nQ  Well, sometime in the late 40s you saw him once or twice?    A   That is correct. \n\nQ   And have been in touch with him how frequently? \n\nA   Since then? \n\nQ   Yes.

I don't remember independently that he did say --\nQ   Did you keep two kinds of files in your office, one purely personal and others that you refer to as working files?\nA   They were all in together, Mr. Murphy, my personal --\nQ   Assuming you wrote to Mr. Case out in Westminster, would that go into the working file under Case?\nA   Yes, it would.   The carbon copy, if I dictated it at the office.\nQ   I think you did in fact dictate them and you did it in Justice?\nA   Yes, sir.\nQ   Did you have a working file over in Justice, too?\nA   Yes, and personal files there.\nQ   Well, that is what I am trying to get at.   Did you have a personal file and an official working file?   Did you have a personal file and an official working file?   Did you have two distinct files?\nA    I don't think they were separate except as there were separate topics in separate envelopes, but I think they were kept in the same file cabinet.\nQ   Would you as a matter of office practice keep a copy of all letters and memoranda that you wrote concerning official matters?\nA   Not in all cases, no."

A   Mr. Murphy, my counsel found them in my personal working papers.\nQ   All right.  Now I will ask the question once more:  where did you get those papers?    A   Well, they were handed to me here in court, Mr. Murphy, when I was on the stand.    I got them from Mr. Cross.\nQ   Prior to being handed them in the courtroom by Mr. Cross, where did you get these papers?    A   I am afraid I don't understand, Mr. Murphy.    They were in my working personal files when I was in Dr. Hornbeck's office in the State Department.    I wrote the memorandum.    I am not sure I understand what you mean by where I got them. \nQ   You wrote the memorandum which is not part of the first page?    A   That is correct."

MURPHY:  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this top page, disregarding the message, which I won't read, has two stamps on it, one the Secretary of State November 13, 1939, \"Noted.    Adviser on Political Relations, Mr. Hornbeck, November 13, 1939, Department of State, \" and then in handwriting \"Return to Mr. HIss's copy,\" and then also in pencil handwriting \"Hiss memorandum.   Neutrality,\" \nand underscored, and then \"Read PAH.   Hiss.\" \n\nQ   Now it is your testimony that you took this exhibit from your personal file when you left the State Department? \n\nA   Yes. \n\nQ   And that was so even though it had physically been in the Secretary of State's office and by him or someone there marked with a stamp?     A     That is correct. \n \nQ   What record exists in the State Department to show that the Secretary of State in 1939 saw your memorandum? \n\nA   I don't know whether any record exists of that.\n\nQ   Isn't it fair to state that there is no record? \n\nA   Well, the ribbon copy which I assume is in the Department now may have such a notation on it, Mr. Murphy.

The ribbon copy was given, according to my recollection, by me to Judge Hackworth, the Legal Adviser, who was the one I thought \nprimarily interested in it.   That was undoubtedly returned to Mr. Hornbeck's office and we may have noted on the face of it that a copy had been sent by Dr. Hornbeck to the \nSecretary for the Secretary's attention.     It is customary to note on the original, very frequently, what has been done with copies, but that is the only copy of the memorandum that was sent to the Secretary of State. \n\nQ  In other words, on the original memorandum might be noted in pencil or in ink a legend to the effect that the Secretary had seen it?    A   Had seen a copy of it.   That is possible.    I don't know.\n\nQ   But in the absence of that there would be no record? \n\nA   That is correct. \n\nQ   Now, this was a memorandum that you had written and which you showed to Dr. Hornbeck?     A    Among others, yes.\n\nQ   And the Legal Adviser?     A   Yes, and several others. \n\nA   And it was written on a question of international law?    A   That is correct. \n\nQ   I think you told us that it was written, what"

That is not what you saw? \n\nA   That is not what I remember.    What I remember was black where this is white and white where this is black; but I may be mistaken. \n\nQ   In other words, black, somewhat similar to Government's Exhibit 60, the photostat of the letter you had written to Mr. Field?    A   That is my recollection. \n\nA   And you say you saw it after this exhibit was introduced in evidence?    A   Yes, I think so.  I think we were not able to get access to that until it was produced here in court, Mr. Murphy. \n\nQ   And do you know how the copy that you saw was made? \n\nA   No, I do not. \n\nQ   Well, did you see the original when it was introduced, the one I am holding in my hand?

A   No, I do not know anything about that.\nQ   So that up until the time that the State Department produced this passport application you had no idea in what name, if any, Mr. Chambers had ever applied for a passport?\nA   Absolutely, except as I say that we had had a tip during the summer that he had been abroad two or three times.    Prior to that tip during the summer I had no idea that he had been abroad at all during this period.    I had heard him testify before that he went over in 1924 or thereabouts.\nQ   And your testimony is that you never inquired of Mr. Rosenwald what the name of the informer was?\nA   That is correct.\nQ   Or in what manner he got the information?\nA   That is correct.\nQ   And you cannot recall now when it was that he received it in relation to the letter that was written to Mrs. Shipley?    A   I think I can tell you when I first heard about it from him, and I think it was in the latter part of August when I was coming down weekends and started",

A    Yes. It is a long trip.\nQ    And you don't recall anything specific about the trip?     A    Not specifically, no.\nQ    Do you recall where you left him off in New York?    A    No, I don't specifically. Probably wherever it was convenient for him and fitted in with where I was going, but I don't recall the specific place.\nQ    Did he come back with you?     A    No, he did not.\nQ    Do you remember how long he stayed in New York?\nA    No, I don't, because I don't remember which particular trip it was.\nQ    Was Mrs. Hiss with you?     A    No, I am confident now she was not.    I am not sure when the question was first asked me, but I am sure she was not.\nQ    At one time you thought she was with you?\nA    I thought she may have been.     I said I would have to speak to her and find out.\nQ    And since that time - that is when you were before the House?     A    Yes.\nQ    And that makes you rather confident she was not?"

A    It could have been, but I am not at all sure. \nQ   You think that if that was the occasion, that that is where Mr. Chambers learned of your acquaintanceship with Lamb?     A    Not necessarily. If I had seen Mr. Lamb earlier I might have mentioned Mr. Lamb to him in the course of that trip or on some other occasion.\nQ   Well, there is no doubt that you probably did mention Colone[l] Lamb?     A    I would think I must have.\nQ   I think as a matter of fact you paid Mr. Lamb some money, did you not? \nA    I don't have any recollection of ever paying him any money.\nQ   Didn't you get some expenses for Mr. Lamb, some reimbursement?     A    It is possible he wanted to do some work for the Nye Committee and I think thought that he might be a helpful witness for the Nye Committee.\nQ   But in any event it is possible that that is where Mr. Chambers learned of your - or at least talk with Colonel Lamb?     A    Quite possible. \nQ   Did you feel free to tell him about a source of information?     A    I am not sure I know what you mean by that.\nQ   Well, I take it that Colonel Lamb was going to be some sort of a source of information to you on behalf of"

I told Mr. Dulles in March of 1948 that I did not understand that there were charges and allegations that Mr. Pressman was a Communist and that that was not the case at the time when I knew him.\n[marginalia] sln3\nQ  So that when you talked with Mr. Dulles you were referring to the charges against Mr. Pressman as of that time or perhaps the year before?\nA   Perhaps a couple of years before, but I was always referring to the fact that I had personally known Mr. Pressman at a considerably earlier date.\nQ   Well, you did not tell Mr. Dulles in words or substance that after you got out of college, law school, you were thrown into association with people who were Communists?\nA   Not in that form; definitely not.\nQ   If that is the form that Mr. Dulles remembers, you were referring not to that time but to some subsequent time when the charges were made, is that correct?\nA   If that was the form Mr. Dulles remembered I would be quite sure that he had put together two periods of time which I had not put together in talking to him or in my mind."

A    I would assume Mr. Eugene Dennis is a Communist, certainly.\nQ    And that is because you have read it in the paper?\nA    Yes.\nQ   You have no personal knowledge?    A.    No.\nQ   What would you want  in order to give you personal knowlege, Mr. Hiss, that somebody was a Communist - a membership card?    Would a membership card satisfy you?\nA   Yes, it certainly would.\nQ   Anything else?

Did you mean occupied by the Germans?\nA   Yes.\nQ   In February 1945?\nA   That is my recollection, that part of Greece was occupied by the Germans as late as that.\nQ   In February of 1945?\nA   Yes.\nQ   You did not know that they had been completely evacuated in October of 1944, did you?\nA   No, I certainly did not.    I still don't.\nQ   Now you said that when you were out in California, if i understood you correctly, that you had daily conferences with Mr. Tamm?\nA   No, I didn't say that.     I said that reports were made to me daily either by Mr. Tamm or someone on his staff, or by the counter intelligence officers of the Army and Navy.\nQ   Well, can we say with some definiteness that you did not have conferences with Mr. Tamm daily?\nA   I certainly did not.\nQ   Would you say that the conferences you had with him you could possibly count on one hand?\nA   No, I wouldn't be able to say that.     I had several conferences with him, I remember distinctly, in Washington before we even went out setting up the whole security program.     How many times I saw him in San Francisco, I"

I saw them every single day, Mr. Murphy.\nQ   Is it your testimony that the FBI had jurisdiction over the security of the persons of all of the delegates to the conference?\nA   They helped.     I think the Army and Navy counter intelligence people shared and may have considered they had even more authority than the FBI.\nQ   Well, don't you know what jurisdiction they had?     Weren't you in charge, more or less, of the security there?\nA   Mr. Murphy, I was in charge, but the relationship between the FBI and the Army and Navy was never, frankly, entirely clear to me, and I left that largely to them.\nQ   Well, you say these daily reports that you had - did they include daily reports from any FBI agents?\nA   No, the FBI men that I saw every day were in the very next room to mine; there were four or five of them who were on duty there throughout the day and throughout the night.\nQ   By seeing them daily do you mean that you had a conference with them daily?\nA   No, just chatted with them, spoke to them.\nQ   Just the time of day and so forth?     I am interested in what I thought you said - and perhaps I was wrong -"

In other words I had developed the budget, had worked out the recommended program for the succeeding year, had handled all the major correspondence and conferred with the staff daily; was in my office all day practically every day.\nQ   Did Mr. Shotwell do anything at all?\nA   During that period of time Mr. Shotwell did what he had done before.

I was trying to explain what may have given rise to that formulation in your own mind, Mr. Murphy.    Just before he went to Europe, and whether it was the middle of August or a little past the middle I am not sure, Mr. Dulles asked me to come to see him.    Shall I tell you what occurred?"

I am quite sure he said two, maybe he said two or three, but it was not a number.\nQ   But anyway that was the reason for Mr. Dulles calling you?\nA   That is what I understood, yes, sir.\nQ   All right.

He was the only one present.\nQ   When you told him you were contemplating resigning, what did he say?\nA   He either asked me the date that I was contemplating or he may himself, I am not sure, in the course of the discussion which one first suggested the date of sometime in September.    I know that either he or I, and I think it was I, said that I would not like to resign while the hearings were still going on.    I knew at that time that there would be a further public hearing on the 25th of August.\nQ   So that at this conversation you told Mr. Dulles that you were contemplating resigning?\nA   Yes, sir.\nQ   Although you had previously told him on the phone on August 3rd that he had your resignation anytime he wanted it?\nA   That is correct.

A   Mr. Dulles then said that he did not think I should resign while the hearings were going on and without my counsel being consulted and talking either to him or to some other representative member of the Board of Trustees.    My counsel did thereafter talk to Mr. John W. Davis, who became Acting Chairman while Mr. Dulles was abroad.\nQ   Was that the end of that conversation?    A   Yes, sir, as far as I recall it now.\nQ   Did you at that conversation say that you did not want to resign until December?    A    No, sir.    Definitely not.\nQ   Was any date fixed on which you would resign?\nA   I told him at that time, and I think it was in a sense understood, that subject to counsel being consulted I would resign sometime in September, about the middle of September.\nQ   And did you tell him that your counsel was Mr. Marbury?    A   Yes, sir.\nQ   And you wanted to wait until he returned from Europe?    A   I don't remember whether I told him that or not.  Mr. Marbury was then in Europe.\nQ   Do you recall whether or not you resigned before or after you instituted your lawsuit in Baltimore?    A   I did not submit my resignation in writing until December 12th, the occasion of the annual trustees' meeting, Mr. Murphy,"

The custom is for the trustees to meet the night before the dinner meeting.\nQ   And you were interrogated at that dinner meeting?\nA   I offered myself for full questioning and some questions were raised.    That is correct.\nQ   So you were interrogated at that dinner meeting?\nA   Yes.\nQ   And you were interrogated about your prior statement in the House Committee?    A   Yes, to some extent.\nQ   Now, was your resignation accepted?    A   No, it was not.\nQ   When was the term of your office, under the term of the office, to expire?    A   The following May -- this past May.\nQ   In May were you re-elected?    A   No.  I did not run for re-election.\nQ   Your resignation then was accepted prior to the election, was it?    A.   No.    You see, the resignation would only be for the term.    I served out the full term, but prior to the May meeting I notified the trustees that I"

When we went to the Department about the underlying telegrams they did not know there was an underlying telegram.    It was not until the first trial and the Government exhibits were put in that I knew, and my counsel knew, there was a corresponding telegram.\nQ   In other words, you could not determine whether or no the exhibit was in your handwriting until you were satisfied that there was a basic telegram containing that message?\nA   I would not put it quite that way, Mr. Murphy, but that entered into my doubts.\nQ   Let's see if we can follow it along:  When you testified in the grand jury in December of 1948 you told that body that you did not believe that exhibit was in your handwriting?\nA   I said it just did not look like my handwriting, and it still does not look like my normal handwriting.\nQ   There is no doubt now that it is?\nA   There is no doubt, but it just does not look like my usual handwriting.\nQ   There is no doubt that it is your handwriting?\nA   No doubt.

Please read that answer again.\n(Answer again repeated.)\nQ   Now, Mr. Hiss, I have just had the reporter read what you said a few moments ago. You had no doubt when you were shown the enlarged photograph of Baltimore Exhibit 1 that that exhibit was in your handwriting, is that correct?\nA   No, I am sorry, I couldn't be absolutely sure, Mr. Murphy, until I knew the circumstances under which I had written it.\nQ   Well, can we at least agree that what the reporter read is what you said?\nA   Yes, sir. Certainly.\nQ   Now, at what point in the nature of things did you become more than reasonably sure that that exhibit was in your handwriting?\nA   I think, Mr. Murphy, that once I saw the enlargement I was reasonably sure, but I did not feel I understood it thoroughly and still had some lingering doubt until the Government introduced what is called State Exhibit 1, the underlying telegram in the first trial, then I understood it all and I had no doubt whatsoever.\nQ   Was it at that point when you told your then counsel that at that moment you were positive it was yours?"

A   Yes.\nQ   Was there a time when you were not too sure that that was typed in your house?    A   Yes, I wasn't sure at all initially where it had been typed.    I thought I might have dictated it at the office as I did certain personal correspondence.\nQ   Were you asked these questions and did you give these answers in the grand jury on December 14, 1948 --\nMR.

A   I frankly have no idea.\n\"Q   Is there any doubt in your mind, Mr. Hiss, that the statement of Timmy's personality, that typed statement of Timmy's personality was written on that typewriter, the Fansler typewriter?    A   I really have no opinion on that.    I would think it very likely that it was.\n\"Q   Let me point out, Mr. Hiss, that here we have a situation, and when you say you have no opinion on the matter I think it would raise some questions in some people's minds -- the cover letter is in your handwriting?    A   Yes.\n\"Q   The description of Timmy's personality which is referred to in the cover letter is obviously typed by"

A   I do recall that we had that typewriter at that time.\n\"Q   Is there any reason why you wouldn't use that typewriter for that purpose?    A   It is certainly possible that we wouldn't have used it.\n\"Q   For what reason?    A   Because of it not being a very good typewriter.    I do not recall it as ever being a very good machine, and it may quite possibly be that if it was not functioning properly Mrs. Hiss would have used another machine. \n\"Q   Where would you have obtained that other machine?   \n\"A   We might have borrowed it from a friend or neighbor for the specific purpose, or it may have been one of the other machines that I think we had from time to time.\n\"Q   What other makes of machines did you have from time to time?

CROSS:  If your Honor please, of course we have no way of knowing what other testimony related to this matter.    I notice in some of the questions there is a reference to other testimony.    It seems, now that these questions have been read, the grand jury minutes which have not been made available to the defendant should be made available so far as they relate to this subject matter that these questions related to.    So I hope that your Honor will permit us to see other parts of the grand jury minutes that relate to this particular matter.\nMR. MURPHY:  Your Honor, I have no objection, under proper supervision, to permitting the defendant to inspect it.\nTHE COURT:  I think you know the usual procedure, Mr. Cross - for the Judge to examine the minutes of the grand jury, and if there is anything in those minutes that is inconsistent, then the defendant counsel may see them.\nMR.

Now is it your testimony that during the period of your vacation in 1937, and correct me if I am wrong, from about the middle of July \nto about the middle of August you were in Chestertown, Maryland, or its environs, is that correct?    A   Yes.    I spent every night in Chestertown during my vacation.\n\nQ   And that vacation period was the last two weeks in July and the first two weeks in August?    A   Yes, sir. \n\nQ    And when you say you spent the nights in Chestertown, that means that the days you spent either at the boys' camp or somewhere nearby?    A   Yes, that is right. \n\nQ   And by thus defining the times of day and the night and the period we are excluding such cities as Washington?    A   Yes, sir. \n\nQ   And Peterboro?    A   Definitely. \n\nQ   So can't we say with rather some firm determination that during those four weeks you did not leave Chestertown, Maryland, or its environs?    A   Well, I drove up to Elkton, \nI am sure, to meet people coming in on the train or the bus, and I drove to Wilmington to meet my brother-in-law, but except for brief trips a little further away than the \nenvirons I think it is absolutely correct to say Chestertown and its environs. \nQ   And I think you told us on|your direct examination"

That I am not sure. \n\nQ   Excluding those short overnight trips we can say with some definiteness that he too did not go to Washington? \n\nA   Yes, definitely. \n\nQ   And that would cover the period of time from when he went to camp until perhaps Labor Day?    A   Yes.  I don't think he went back to Washington at any time. \n\nQ   Can you fix with any finite time at all the day when he went to camp;  what time in June?    A   No. \n\nQ  Can we say perhaps June 15th?    Can we start with that date?    A   I am really not absolutely sure.    I am quite sure it was sometime in June.    I would not know exactly.    It may have depended upon his own doctor's examination of his leg and wanting him to stay a little longer than he otherwise would have.    I just don't remember exactly.\n\nQ   For lack of a better date can we say about the middle of June until at least Labor Day?    A   I would think it was.    It could have been a little later than the middle of June."

I remember being there the 4th of July specifically. \n\nQ   Now, when you moved from the 30th Street house to Volta Place there was still an unexpired term under your 30th Street lease?    A   That is correct. \n\nQ   Do you remember offhand how many months or so it was?    A   I think it ran until September, but I am not sure. \n\nQ   But there was a balance still to be paid for which you were obligated to the landlord?    A   Yes, but it was certainly more than two or three months.    It was a good \nperiod of time;  at least half a year I am quite sure. \n\nQ   And you were able for that period of time to get a sub-tenant of your own?    A   I left that up to Mr. Gilliat, and he found a sub-tenant for it. \n\nQ   So there was no lapse.    The tenant commenced paying rent when you started to pay rent in Volta Place?    A   Well, in December I made a payment of $100 on the Volta Place house, but there was not rent coming in from my sub-tenant, who did not go in until the 1st of January. \n\nQ   You stayed in 30th Street until almost the end of December?    A   Yes. \n\nQ   So that commencing in January you had a tenant for your 30th Street house?  \nA    That is correct. \n\nQ   And that was arranged, you say, through Mr. Gilliat?"

A   That is correct.\nQ   Mr. Hollander was lessee for the balance of the term of your 30th Street lease, an unfurnished house?\nA   Yes, and I think he had assurance he could stay on after the termination.    They stayed on for two or three years.\nQ   Be that as it may, you entered into a written lease for this amount for that term?    A   And with Mr. Gilliat.    Mr. Gilliat was a party to the lease.\nQ   What was his character in the lease?    You were leasor and the other man was lessee.    What was Mr. Gilliat?\nA   He was the agent for me.\nQ   He was not a party to the lease?    A   I think he signed it.\nQ   Assuming he signed it, he would not be a party.    There were two parties to the lease, a lessor and lessee, and you were the lessor and this gentleman was the lessee, and some man acted as your agent and signed it?    A   Yes.\nQ   Now, were you able to get a little bit more rent"

MURPHY:  May I have that checkbook?\n(Mr. Cross hands book to Mr. Murphy.)\nQ  I take it that it wasn't always your practice to make entries on your check stubs when you wrote a check?    A   I am not sure I know what you mean by that.\nQ   Well, when you wrote a check in your office, perhaps you would not have the stub with you?    A   I would make an entry unless I forgot somewhere in that book.\nQ   Yes, but you would not make it in the space provided in the checkbook always?    A   That is right.    I was just put it in the column.\nQ   In other words, I think you testified about cashing a counter check or two with the bank?"

That was our furniture.\nQ    Did it sort of crowd the house a little bit?\nA    We put a good deal of furniture, some of our own and some of the landlord's, up into one small hall bedroom on the third floor which we used as a storeroom.\nQ   And then when you went over to 30th Street did you have more than enough furniture to cover 30th Street?\nA   We had about enough.    It was a very small house.\nQ   Was 30th Street larger or smaller than P Street?\nA    Oh, much smaller than P Street.\nQ   Much smaller?\nA    Yes, sir.\nQ   So that in P Street which was larger you had this extra furniture stored in some third floor room?\nA    Yes, sir.\nQ    And then moving to a smaller house on 30th Street"

Hiss-cross                                               2950\n\nyou were able to use the furniture you had stored because it was an unfurnished house?\nA   Yes.    We did not store all our furniture; it was sort of a mixture; some of our pieces, but particularly some of the landlord's pieces we put in that storeroom.\nQ    I don't know whether the jury understands it.     Was 30th Street a furnished or unfurnished house?\n    A I am sorry, I must have misunderstood you. I was still talking about the storeroom. P Street. P Street was a furnished house. The landlord left rather a sparse quantity of furniture, not over-furnished. When we moved in we got along on the landlord's furniture until after the Crosbys' sub-lease had expired. We then brought our own furniture, and some of our furniture -- some of our landlord's pieces we had been using we put in a third floor bedroom we used as a storeroom. 30th Street was an unfurnished house and we used only our own furniture.\n   Q Well, would it be fair to say that the furniture that you used at 30th Street was, in substance, the furniture you had furnished 28th Street with?\n   A Yes, and 3411 O Street. It was furniture we had for some time, since we got married, as a matter of fact.\n   Q And it was enough to at least adequately furnish 30th Street?\n   A That was my recollection. We may have gotten a few additional things, I don't recall."

A   Yes.    There is a check on December 29 for a larger amount which was for moving furniture from 30th Street to Volta Place, but that small amount you have noticed for a period of some months was storing the rug that there has been testimony about, that is right.\nQ   When you say it was that you moved that rug from the warehouse to the attic where Timmy's room was?\nA   I think it was a couple of months after we moved into Volta Place.    I don't know, and I have not checked recently, but I should think it was about March or April; it could be February; I just don't remember exactly.\nQ   In other words, you bought some extra furniture for Timmy's room, the bed and work bench?    A   Yes.\nQ   A chest of drawers, but you did not immediately put the rug down?    A   That is right.\nQ   There is no doubt that you subsequently did?\nA   Oh no, very shortly.   I think you can tell from these check stubs the exact date.\nQ   Now you say that in 1937 Christmastime you were in New York?    A   Yes, sir.\nQ   And I think you said that you were able to fix the time because you saw this counter check for $60 on December 22?    A   That is not the only reason I know I"

Conceivably we may have got back the night of the 27th or the afternoon of the 27th.\nQ   But the point I want to make is that you moved the next day?    A   Either the next day or the day after the next day, very shortly after we got back.\nQ   Well, for a period of time, four days, five days, whatever it was, you and Mrs. Hiss and the boy were in New York?

A   Yes, sir.\nQ   And the next day was the day that you moved from 30th Street to Volta Place, the 29th?    A   As I just said, if we got back on the 28th then it was the very next day. If we got back on the 27th then it was --\nQ   Didn't you testify in your direct examination that you got back on the 28th?\nA    I thought it was about that based on my recollection of a counter check of the 28th.\nQ   If your recollection is correct then you moved the next day, December 29th? \nA   Yes.\nQ   So that for the preceding four or five days you both were not in the 30th Street house?\nA   That is correct.\nQ   You were out of the city?    A   Yes, sir.\nQ   Now, in 1936, Christmastime, is it your testimony that you and Mrs. Hiss were also out of the city of Washington?    A   Christmas Day and a few days connected with Christmas - that is before and after - we were both out of the city.\nQ   How many days prior to Christmas and after Christmas 1936 is it your testimony you were out of the City of Washington?    A   I really don't know, and I don't have any check stubs to help me on that, Mr. Murphy."

A very brief time.\nQ   There is nothing that can help you on that?\nA   No, nothing that I know of.\nQ   But you are rather positive that you were out of the city two or three days around Christmastime of 1936?\nA  That is correct.\nQ  And Mrs. Hiss was out of town longer?    A   Yes.\nQ   And that is because of the letter that you have introduced that refreshes your recollection of that time?\nA   It is because of the chickenpox.    We remember that very definitely.\nQ  And you would remember that with or without the letter?    A   We have remembered that with or without the letter, and so have all the children who had it.\nQ   So that we are agreed that around Christmastime in 1936 you were away from the City of Washington for two or three days?    A  Yes.\nQ   And in 1937 from the 22nd or 23rd, to and including the 28th?    A   27th or 28th, I am not absolutely sure.    I am going - as far as the time span is concerned, I am going on those counter checks.    I am not sure of the total time I was absent.\n We are agreed that it was at least one day other than Christmas; can we get that definitely?"

A   I don't have any recollection of seeing him at the 28th Street apartment or the P Street house.    I would not be prepared to say positively he may not have been there, but I have no recollection of seeing him either at 28th Street or 2905 P Street.

I think she said she remembered Mr. Pressman coming to the house, but, you see she was at O Street too with us.    I don't think Mrs. Catlett did testify at all about that.\nQ   Whatever she said you will let the record say?\nA   Oh, certainly.\nQ   Now, when you started your lawsuit in Baltimore had you had prior litigation experience as a lawyer?\nA   Had I?    As an assistant in the Gillette case, and an assistant in a case that did not actually come to trial when I was with Cotton, Franklin. In the Gillette case we actually tried it for a number of days before a master.    I was an assistant to Mr. Hall in that case.\nQ   And that was prior to the formation of the new Federal Rules?    A   Oh yes.\nQ   What experience had you with the new Federal Rules of Civil Practice at the time your Baltimore lawsuit had started?    A   I guess I had none before that.\nQ   Now that lawsuit was not started pursuant to an agreement between you and Mr. Chambers, was it?\nA   Certainly not."

I have never followed it up that closely.\nQ   In other words, if Mr. Cross said in his opening something about Mr. Wadleigh, that would be a privileged statement of Mr. Cross?    A   I don't know, I have never thought about openings.    I would think that would follow, but I don't know.\nQ   In any event, you wanted Mr. Chambers to say it some place in public and not protected by these laws that protect witnesses before congressional committees?\nA   Exactly.\nQ   And he did so publicly, over a radio?

A   Yes, sir.\nQ   Or slander?    A   Yes.\nQ   And then he put in his answer and he pleaded truth as a defense, is that correct? A   Yes.\nlon10 \nQ   And you tell this Court and jury that as you remember the law in law school that is a perfect defense?\nA    If it is sustained.\nQ   Truth is a perfect defense, is that the way the Hornbook says it?    A   If believed.\nQ   But truth, there can't be any question about truth?\nA   That is right.    But merely filing the answer as you put it is not a perfect defense.\nQ   But truth is a perfect defense?    A   Yes.\nQ   You can't distinguish truth, can you?    A   I quite agree, truth is a defense.\nQ   Truth is a perfect defense?    A   It certainly is.\nQ   He admitted saying what you charged him with saying in his answer?    A   Yes.\nQ   And pleaded that it was true?    A   He pleaded that it was true, that is correct.\nQ   But all you did was you charged that it was libel; that is as far as you have gone, you have just charged that it is libelous?

A   It all depends on the particular step, Mr. Murphy.\nQ   Well, you have had no litigation experience other than what you have told us. You said you assisted this man in Boston once and you worked on a case in New York in 1932 or 1933.    A   Yes, and I was in the State Department in charge, in a supervisory sense, of the litigation in the Trade Agreements Act.    Oh no, I am not an experienced litigation lawyer at all.\nQ   But you told Mr. Marbury to examine Mr. Chambers?\nA   Mr. Marbury and Mr. McLean and I discussed the problem and I urged him to take all possible speedy steps.\nQ   Then I say that it was discussed between you three that the action should be brought in the Federal Court because of the liberality of examinations before trial? Was that one of the considerations?\nA   I frankly don't remember whether that was one of the reasons or not.    I think it played a part.\nQ In other words all you have to do is give a notice to the lawyer that you want to examine a party or a witness on material allegations?    A   That is right."

A That is correct.\nQ And that examination commenced in November and continued, with some interruptions, until March of 1949?\nA Yes. The interruptions were more numerous than testimony.

A That is right.\nQ Do you remember when it was, without looking at the checks? A I think it was September 1937 we first sent it to storage.\nQ And that was after you had it in 30th Street from, I take it, the time you moved in July 1936 until September, if that is the date when you put it in storage?

A I think - we took it out from where?\nQ From storage. A Well, whenever the last item is. I don't remember how long those 48-cent items run to, but if you will look at the transcript -- \nQ But you thought it was a matter of a few months after you moved into Volta Place? A That is right.\nQ And you thought it might be some time shortly after May? A Yes. We had it so long at Volta Place that I thought it was earlier than May.\nQ And if you took it out in the summer and laid it down in the summertime, that is the fact?\nA That is when we did it.\nQ I think on your direct testimony you said that it was Mr. Kohlberg who had first written to Mr. Dulles.\nA So Mr. Dulles' letter told me. He did not tell me at the time he telephoned.\nQ When was it that Mr. Dulles told you Mr. Kohlburg was the man who had written? A I think it was at the time I talked to him in March 1948, right after I had been before the grand jury and went to tell him about tht.\nQ Are you sure about that, Mr. Hiss? A No.\nQ Can I suggest you learned the name from some other",

This was the only identification they got of him.\n   Q Did you make any effort or inquiry after that to ascertain who Whittaker Chambers was?\n   A No, nor did I with respect to some 20 other similar names that were asked of me.\n   Q My question, of course, was did you make any attempt or inquiry as to who Whittaker Chambers was, and your answer is \"No\"?\n   A No. It never occurred to me.\n   Q Now you heard that name Whittaker Chambers again, did you not?\n   A I heard that name \"Chambers\" again.

I asked several of the press men who called me whom I knew personally what else they knew about him. That was the extent to which I instituted inquiries.\nQ Can we say that prior to testifying on August 5th that is the extent of your inquiry? A It is, definitely.\nQ So prior to August of '48 you had heard the name three times?

A Well, Mr. Murphy, when I heard that it was apparently a mistake I did not so regard it. When he made it before Congress I certainly so regarded it.\nQ When you testified on August 5th did you say in words or substance that\"The name Whittaker Chambers means nothing to me\"? A Yes, I knew nobody of that name, I was absolutely sure.\nQ You didn't tell the members of Congress that \"The name Whittaker Chambers has been recurring three times, although I don't know who the man is\"? A If I didn't that day I did very shortly thereafter.\nQ Well, on August 5th you said in words or substance that \"The name Whittaker Chambers means nothing to me\"?\nA Yes, in the sense that I knew no such person. I said that, Mr. Murphy, in connection with a question of whether I knew the man, and I said the name means nothing to me.\nQ In other words, you didn't answer the questions whether you knew the man; you said the name means nothing to you? A I was shown a photograph and I said I wouldn't want to take an oath that I don't know the person whose photograph I am shown, but the name means nothing to me, I don't know of anybody by that name.",

If you tell me so, I will accept it without any question, but I don't, Mr. Murphy.\n\nQ  Well, can you tell us some of the names that you were asked about, whether you remembered or knew who they were or not?\n\nA  I can tell you as of May-June 1947 meeting, and that same statement was read in March 1948.  I was asked at least three names like Chambers of people of whom I knew somebody with the same last name, and their names I remember very well.  Otherwise I didn't know the people.  Post and Sayre, as well as Chambers.  I was then asked a number of names, and I would hesitate to try to recall them, but if you have the statement I would be very glad to tell you which ones I didn't know and which ones I did, and the number of people whom I did know.  I was definitely asked about Mr. Pressman at that time;  I think I was asked about Mr. Abt at that time;  I think I was asked about Mr. Witt; I think I was asked about Mr. Collins, and a number of people whom I did know.\n\nTHE COURT:  Mr. Murphy, I think that you probably will not finish this line this afternoon.  We will have to adjourn until tomorrow morning.\n\nTomorrow morning, members of the jury, there is a motion to be argued at half-past ten, so you need not get here until eleven.\n\n(Adjourned to December 28, 1949, at 10.30 a.m.)"
