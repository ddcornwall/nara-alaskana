# nara-alaskana
National Archives Alaskana Explorer

This is an informal project to provide better access to digitized Alaskana materials within the National Archives Catalog at https://catalog.archives.gov/.

The project goals are:
1) Provide access to the most recently digitized Alaskana within the National Archives Catalog.
2) Provide a search limited to US National Archives "Alaska Digitization Project."
3) Provide browsing access to digitized materials in five "important" Alaska history topics


While others are very welcome to join the project, this is an off hours project for me (Daniel Cornwall) and has no current connection to any institution within Alaska. It is driven by my interests in Alaska history and application programming interfaces (APIs) coding.
