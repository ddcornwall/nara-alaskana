The purpose of this file is to keep track of things that I think will come in handy when I start the actual code.

Notes from NARA Catalog API search/export at https://github.com/usnationalarchives/Catalog-API/blob/master/search_and_export.md

Sorting results
The results set can be sorted by a given field by using the sort= parameter in combination with the field name and either asc or desc, separated by a space. For example, sort=naId asc (or, with URL encoding sort=naId%20asc). So, sorting the query for the keyword "navy" by NAIDs from lowest to highest is:

[https://catalog.archives.gov/api/v1/?q=navy&sort=naId asc](https://catalog.archives.gov/api/v1/?q=navy&sort=naId asc)
Fields are coded as either string, integer, or datetime, so that they should sort according to the correct logic.

Known issue:

Sort is not yet working across all fields. The API is currently coded so that if a field is not sortable, attempting to sort by it will return an error (rather than silently ignoring the parameter).
